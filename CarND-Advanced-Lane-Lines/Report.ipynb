    "I used OpenCV functions findChessboardCorners and calibrateCamera here. A number of images of a chessboard, taken from different angles with the same camera, comprise the input. Arrays of object points, corresponding to the location (essentially indices) of internal corners of a chessboard, and image points, the pixel locations of the internal chessboard corners determined by findChessboardCorners, are fed to calibrateCamera which returns camera calibration and distortion coefficients. These can then be used by the OpenCV undistort function to undo the effects of distortion on any image produced by the same camera. \n",
    "\n",
    "I start by preparing \"object points\", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  \n",
